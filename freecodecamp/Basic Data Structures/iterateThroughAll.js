/* Iterate Through All an Array's Items Using For Loops
We have defined a function, filteredArray, which takes arr, a nested array,
and elem as arguments, and returns a new array.
elem represents an element that may or may not be present on one or more of the arrays nested within arr.
Modify the function, using a for loop, to return a filtered version of the passed array such that any
array nested within arr containing elem has been removed. */

function filteredArray(arr, elem) {
    let newArr = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if(arr[i].indexOf(elem) === -1) {
            newArr.push(arr[i]);
      }
    }
    return newArr;
}
  
console.log(filteredArray([[3, 2, 3], [1, 6, 3], [3, 13, 26], [19, 3, 9]], 3));
