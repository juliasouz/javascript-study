/* Add Items to an Array with push() and unshift()
We have defined a function, mixedNumbers, which we are passing an array as an argument.
Modify the function by using push() and unshift() to add 'I', 2, 'three' to the beginning of the array and 7,
'VIII', 9 to the end so that the returned array contains representations of the numbers 1-9 in order. */

    arr.unshift('I', 2, 'three');
    arr.push(7,'VIII', 9);
    return arr;
